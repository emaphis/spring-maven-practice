# Easy Text

- An example program for analyzing text. 

## Demonstrates modular program features.

• It has the ability to add new analysis algorithms without modifying or recompiling
existing modules.

• Different front-ends (for example GUI and command-line) are able to use the
same analysis logic.

• It must support different configurations, without recompilation and without
deploying all code for each configuration.

• It uses existing (possibly non-modularized) libraries where necessary.
